# Data Analysis of IPL Matches using Cumulative Frequency Distribution

This project aims to analyze the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches held between 2008 and 2019 using cumulative frequency distribution.The project specifically focuses on calculating the win by wickets percentile for different queries such as "less than a certain number of wickets" or "more than a certain number of wickets"



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies
4. Open Jupyter Notebook and run the code in the notebook


## Data

The IPL match data used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information such as match results, team names, and wickets lost. The data is preprocessed to only include the matches between 2008 and 2019.

## Analysis 

The project uses cumulative frequency distribution to analyze the win by wickets data. The analysis includes calculating the percentile for different queries such as "less than a certain number of wickets" or "more than a certain number of wickets". The results are visualized using Matplotlib.


## Results

The project shows the percentage of matches won by a certain number of wickets and provides insights on the most common win by wicket scenarios. It also provides the percentile for different queries such as "less than a certain number of wickets" or "more than a certain number of wickets"

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the use of cumulative frequency distribution for analyzing sports data and provides insights on the most common win by wicket scenarios in the Indian Premier League. It also provides the percentile for different queries such as "less than a certain number of wickets" or "more than a certain number of wickets" which can be used to make predictions and inform strategies for teams.
